# **About Me:**

I am someone who always seeks to solve problems by using analytical/creative thinking and resolution methods, breaking down the problem into smaller pieces to make it easier to solve.

I have skills in programming, with Python as my main language. Experience in Python and SQL for ETL. Development of pipelines using Airflow for Orchestration and Containerization with Docker.

Data has always been my focus‚ÄîI find the whole process fascinating, from extracting raw data, cleaning and transforming it, properly modeling it, to building charts and structuring reports, extracting insights, and communicating through storytelling.

* üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy solving problems, always looking for the best solution. I am good at logic and love challenges.
* üë®‚Äçüíª Tools in progress: Python, SQL, Airflow, Snowflake, Docker, AWS.
* üíº Experience: +2 years in data field.
